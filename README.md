[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/47c98e47-8219-4483-9da8-cd3b96f8c219/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/sgfairchild/deploys)

This is a random site I use to dump pictures, memories and more related to my family and hobbies for public access. I share this site when discussing things we do for fun with friends or family. Sometimes I'll be at t-ball practice and when the dads are talking about BBQ I bust this bad boy out and show off my smoked pork shoulder. Or most recently when at the LEGO store in Cincinatti I showed the store clerk a custom LEGO design my son made. 

For the stack I use:
- NextJS as a blog framework
- SanityCMS as a content database. The CMS itself is decoupled. You can view that code [here](https://github.com/stephenfairchild/sgfairchild.com-CMS).
- Tailwind CSS and Styled Components for styling and CSS

It's deployed with Netlify.
